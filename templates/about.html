  <h1>About Voices of Artsakh</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Voices of Artsakh is a digital documentation and education project dedicated to preserving first-hand
    testimonies from those connected to Artsakh. The archive centers human stories and makes them accessible
    for students, educators, and global audiences.

  <div class="info-block">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The project began after hearing classmates describe displacement, loss, and resilience firsthand.
      These personal accounts demonstrated how easily lived experiences can be lost without careful
      preservation. The archive ensures these voices remain visible, respected, and meaningful.
